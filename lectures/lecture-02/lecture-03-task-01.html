        <h2>My main hobby - Pinball</h2>
        <p>
          I started playing pinball about four years ago. What I like about this
          hobby is both learning a new skill like controlling chaos (the ball),
          aiming (shooting the ball where you want), there is no limit of how
          good you can get (there is always a high-score to beat) and the people
          you meet.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a lot more to say about pinball but it's a great hobby both
          for the competative person, the tinkerer or just if you have infinite
          money to spend (buying pinball machines is not cheap).
