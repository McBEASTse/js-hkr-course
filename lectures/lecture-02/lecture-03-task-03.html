              Partisan Conflict: Democrats released selected emails to raise

            <strong>US lawmakers</strong>
            have released over
            <mark>20,000 pages</mark>
            of documents from the estate of the convicted sex offender
            <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>
            , some of which mention
            <mark>President Donald Trump</mark>
            . Democrats on the
            <em>House Oversight Committee</em>
            initially released a few email exchanges, including some between
            Epstein and his associate
            <strong>Ghislaine Maxwell</strong>
            , as well as author
            <strong>Michael Wolff</strong>
            . In response,
            <em>House Republicans</em>
            quickly released a much
            <em>larger</em>
            set of documents, claiming the Democrats were "cherry-picking" and
            trying to "
            <mark>create a fake narrative to slander President Trump.</mark>
            " The White House echoed this, with
            <strong>Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt</strong>
            asserting the emails were "selectively leaked" to
            <em>smear</em>
            the president, and maintaining that Trump had severed ties with
            Epstein years ago over his inappropriate behavior,
            <mark>despite having been friends with him previously</mark>
            .
