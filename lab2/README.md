# Lab 2 - Interactive Portfolio Enhancement with Git Workflow

This is a simple web page with some simple JavaScript. It's an assignment for a course in JavaScript, so nothing fancy. Personally I would not rate my own skills in any way, and there is still work to be done regarding UX and the design.

And I also stored all my lectures here and I'm to lazy to remove them and create another repo for just them so... you're welcome?

## How to run it

As it's just a static web page, you only need to download the repo, extract it to desired directory and open up index.html in your prefered browser. If you want, you can use LiveServer for real time updates if you want to change anything.

## What's not implemented

- Being able to send messages. As it is now, it just checks if the contact form is valid or not, and if it's valid, the form resets.
- The menu should be a compact click-out-menu when on smaller screens; using a "regular" desktop menu on mobile devices is just bad design. For this I need to create a script that can hide and display the menu on click, but this was not in the assignment.

## Documentation

I used a different branch, lab-2-contact-form, for this assignment. So check there for a more focused timeline of this lab. Regarding comments, most comments are self explanatory and mostly notes for myself.

## Now what?

As this is the second lab of two, I have to finish up the first lab. So there are some WCAG code missing in the HTML, such as aria labels, and I will write a report and hopefully have some screenshots of the process that I can share.

## Any last words?

Yes. Three actually.
