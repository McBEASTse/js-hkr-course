# Lab 2 - Interactive Portfolio Enhancement with Git Workflow

This is a simple web page with some simple JavaScript. It's an assignment for a course in JavaScript, so nothing fancy.

## Why?

Because I want to learn JavaScript, and also have some kind of confirmation that I actually have some basic knowledge instead of just saying "I watched some tutorials on YouTube".

## How to run it

Just download the repo, unpack it to any directory, and open the index.html file in some browser. If you don't know how to do this, I'm sorry.

## It this the best you got?

Not really, but working a full time job and having two small kids and studying during the holiday season is kind of a struggle. I would want to do the Grade 4 assignment, but I'll just do it on my spare time instead so I can learn arrays also.

## Now what?

As this is the second lab of two, I have to finish up the first lab. So there are some WCAG code missing in the HTML, such as aria labels, and I will write a report and hopefully have some screenshots of the process that I can share.

## Any last words?

Yes. Two.
